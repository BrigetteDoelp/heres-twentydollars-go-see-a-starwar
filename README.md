   I got the quote wrong for the name of this repo, and I am deeply shamed.

## Goals and Objectives
- Recreate a landing page assigned to me by the hiring manager of a company I am interviewing for.
- Write clean and responsive code.
- Impliment the animations specified in the spec to the best of my ability in the limited time frame I was given.

## Wins & Challenges
#### Wins:
- Getting the breakpoints to do what I wanted them to do.
- The warp speed animation.

#### Challenges:
- The warp speed animation. I wound up having to impliment an external package to get the result that I desired. While it did take some doing to get the packing to play nice with the rest of my code, I would have preferred to have made the animation myself in 'GSAP'. 
- Interpreting the project spec in general. I was made to understand that the instructions were intentionally vague, and that was part of the challenge itself. However, I often find myself spinning my gears over vague instruction, and it took a little bit of doing to break through that and just go with my gut in terms of what was going to be acceptable for the completion of the project.
